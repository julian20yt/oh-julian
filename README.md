Measuring 2.83 inches (72 mm),
Chromecast is a dongle that plugs into the HDMI port of a high-definition television or monitor,
while the power is supplied by connecting the device's micro-USB port to an external power supply or a USB port.
The device connects to the Internet through a Wi-Fi connection to the user's home network.
Chromecast offers two methods to stream content to a television: the first employs <strong>Chromecast-enabled mobile apps </strong> and web apps,
the second allows [mirroring]( of most content displayed by the web browser Google Chrome running on a personal computer, as well as content displayed on some Android devices.
In both cases, playback is initiated through the "[cast](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+nexus+s+from+sprint)" button on the controlling device.
Several upcoming features for Chromecast were announced at Google I/O 2014. Users controlling devices will no longer need to be [connected](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Chromecast_plugged_into_TV.jpg) to the same Wi-Fi network as the Chromecast to cast content.
